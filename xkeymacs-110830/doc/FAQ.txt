Or if you depress F after releasing Alt,
File menu is opened by Alt+F when M-f and Alt:Meta are enabled.

Q. Why a mail window is closed of Microsoft Outlook Express when a user depress Esc key as Meta?
A. Assign Esc as commands "Meta" category "Other" on Advanced tab of Properties Dialog.
Esc key is assigned "Meta for Esc" on default setting.

So Esc key work as Meta on Notepad and Esc can close a dialog,

Open Properties dialog and set kill-ring-max 1 and over to connect killed data.
