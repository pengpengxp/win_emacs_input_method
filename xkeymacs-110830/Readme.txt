Usage

### Run and exit

area of the taskbar when XKeymacs is running.

Right-click the gold (or silver) key icon, and select Exit from the
pop up menu.

### Properties

Right-click the gold key icon and select "Properties...", you can
set key assigns per application.

Properties dialog has three tabs: Basic, Advanced and List tab.
The same configuration is shown by a different format in each tab.
In Basic tab, you can configure whether or not each key combination
works like Emacs. In Advanced tab, you can configure keys
assignments for each command. In Lis tab, you can take a look at the
configuration.

### Import and export properties

Select "Import Properties...", you can import an exported file.
Select "Export Properties...", you can export the configuration under the
following registry key to a file. 
**These features do not currently work on Windows 7.**

    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Oishi\XKeymacs2

### Options

Select "Options...", you can set whether or not:
1. run XKeymacs when you logon Windows.
2. enable file completion on the Command Prompt.
3. display C-x-, Shift, Ctrl and Alt LED in the notification area.

### Keyboard layout

Select "Keyboard Layout...", you can modify the keyboard layout.
Drag & drop a key from the base keyboard to the remapped keyboard.
The dropped key turns red. You can cancel the remap by clicking the red key.
**This feature does not currently work on Windows 7.**

XKeymacs only uses the feature of remapping scan codes provided by Windows,
so the remapping is not canceled after you disable or uninstall XKeymacs.
If you want to cancel remmapping without XKeymacs, delete the following
value by regedit.

    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Keyboard Layout\Scancode Map
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout\Scancode Map
